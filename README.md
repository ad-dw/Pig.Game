# Dice Game: Race to 100 🎲

This is a simple two-player dice game where the first player to reach 100 points wins! The game involves rolling dice, managing risk, and making strategic decisions.

## 🎮 How to Play

#### 1. Roll the Dice

- Each player takes turns rolling the dice.
- The value rolled is added to the player's current score.

#### 2. Hold or Risk

- Players can choose to "Hold" at any time during their turn.
- The current score is added to their total score.
- It then becomes the next player's turn.
- If a player rolls a 1, they lose all their current score for that turn, but their total score remains unchanged. The turn automatically passes to the other player.

#### 3. Winning the Game

- The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game!
